# FlappyBirdGame-Python
An endless game that includes a bird controlled by the player. The objective of this game is to prevent the bird from falling on the ground or colliding with obstacles like pipes. Every time the bird passes through the pipes, the scores increment by one. The game ends when the bird collides with the pipes or falls on the ground due to gravity.
